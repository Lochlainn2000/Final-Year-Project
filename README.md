This is the part of the project where the app is created using Unity.

There are 4 scenes with each having different functions. The Scenes are the Home scene, the generate image scene, the sample scene(AR mode) and the upload scene.

This part of the project is where the user is prompted to enter an idea to generate an AI tattoo design. The user enters an idea into the prompt field and presses generate.

When the image is returned to the app the user can either choose to regenerate the image, go back to the home scene or press accept which will take the user to the sample scene where the user can view the tattoo.

If the user pressed back in the generate image scene after generating an image, the user is brought back to the home scene where the user can see the images you have generated before. From there you can either delete the images by pressing the "X" button or go straigth to the sample scene by pressing the ":)" button. This will allow the user to view images they generated before.

In the sample scene the user can also press the home button to take them back to the home scene. If the user clicks on the generated image in the sample scene, a panel is brought up with sliders that change the image size, rotation and trasnperency.

In the Home scene if the user decides they do not want to generate an image, but have an image in their phones gallery that they decided they want to try, they can press the upload button. This brings the user to the upload scene.

In the upload scene the user can press the upload button and will be asked for permission to acces their gallery. If the user accepts the user can upload an image from their phone and either press back or accept. Back button will again bring the user back to the home scene and the accept will again bring the user to the AR sample scene. The user can then view the image they selected.

Upload scene does not save the image to the home scene as the users image has came from their phone gallery already.
